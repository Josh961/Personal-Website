      <p class="info">
        Hi, my name is Josh and I'm currently in my last semester at The University of Pittsburgh.
        I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a certificate in Russian and East European Studies.
        I have a passion for all aspects of programming and CS in general. I'm currently doing full stack
        web development and learning more each and every day. I enjoy both the front and back end of
        web development, but also really enjoy coding a hashing algorithm, writing testable / well written
        code, and employing the best practices of object oriented design. On the side, I like to work on UI
        and graphic design. I feel like it's important to at least familiarize myself with all aspects of software
        development to gain a well rounded understanding of what goes into it.

      <p class="info">
        I was born and raised in Pittsburgh to Ukrainian parents. We speak Russian at home and eat borscht.
        I'm really into wrestling ü§º, Brazilian jiu-jitsu ü•ã, motorcycles üèçÔ∏è, and foreign languages üó∫Ô∏è. If I'm not
        busy
        coding, you can usually find me training on the mats, riding around town, or studying Russian.
