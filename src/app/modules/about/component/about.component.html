        Hi, my name is Josh and I'm currently working as a software engineer building APIs and web applications
        within the healthcare space. I graduated from The University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor's in Computer
        Science and a certificate in Russian and East European Studies.

        I love working as a full stack developer and spend the majority of my time coding in Angular for our frontend
        and C# for our backend (along with SQL). I'm a stickler for well written code. Constant refactoring. No trailing
        whitespace. Rebasing instead of merging to resolve conflicts. And all the other nitpicky details that unfortunately
        get overlooked. Writing software is a craft. One which requires consistent improvement and making plenty of mistakes!

        I was born and raised in Pittsburgh to Ukrainian parents. We speak Russian at home and eat borscht.
        I'm really into wrestling ü§º, Brazilian jiu-jitsu ü•ã, motorcycles üèçÔ∏è, and foreign languages üó∫Ô∏è. If I'm not
        busy coding, you can usually find me training on the mats, riding around town, or studying Russian.
